Upon my word, man is created weaker and more base than you supposed! Can
he, can he perform the deeds of which you are capable? In respecting him
so much you acted as though you had ceased to have compassion for him,
because you demanded too much of himâ€”and yet who was this? The very one
you had loved more than yourself! Had you respected him less you would
have demanded of him less, and that would have been closer to love, for
his burden would have been lighter. He is weak and dishonourable.
